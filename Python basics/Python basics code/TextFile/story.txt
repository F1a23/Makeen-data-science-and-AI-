Once upon a time in a small village, there lived a wise old man. 
The villagers often came to him for advice. 
He always told them, "The greatest knowledge comes from observation and patience." 
One day, a young boy asked, "How can I become wise like you?" 
The old man smiled and said, "Learn to listen, learn to observe, and never stop asking questions."
The villagers were amazed at his wisdom and kindness.
